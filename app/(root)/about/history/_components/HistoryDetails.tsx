          Although agricultural research in Nigeria started in the late 19
          century with the establishment of a botanical garden in Lagos, there
          was always a problem with the coordination of the research centres and
          institutes. The botanical garden was part of a network of gardens
          established under British rule, focusing on the introduction of new
          crops. In 1903 the Forestry and Botanical Department (renamed
          Agricultural Department) for southern Nigeria was created. In 1912
          this was divided into two regional departments resulting in the
          establishment of a Department of Agriculture for northern Nigeria.
          Then in 1914, with Nigeria&apos;s unification, the two departments
          were merged to form a new Department of Agriculture.

          Progress was made in terms of infrastructure and human resources
          resulting in new research stations, more research personnel, and a
          more technical research program that included plant. breeding and
          plant pathology. Research continued to focus, however, on export crops
          like oil palm, rubber, cotton and cocoa. The Forestry and Veterinary
          Departments were also established in 1914, but only began undertaking
          research activities in 1920. Fishery research came much later, in
          1941, with the establishment of the Fisheries Development Branch by
          the Department of Agriculture.

          Agricultural research was largely the domain of the local colonial
          government until World War Il, when the British government sought a
          more active role in the promotion of science and technology in its
          colonies, which led to the creation of several regional agricultural
          research organizations in West Africa that complemented or partially
          replaced existing facilities and which were part of the West African
          Inter-territorial Research Organisation (WAIFRO). Three of these: the
          West African Institute for Oil palm Research (WAIFOR), the West Africa
          Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research (WAITR), and the West African
          Stored Products Research Unit (WASPRU) were located in Nigeria. With
          independence in 1960, the regional institutes were nationalized and
          the Nigerian Institute for oil palm Research (NIFOR), Nigerian
          Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research (NITR), Nigerian Stored
          Products Research Institute (NSPRI) and Cocoa Research Institute of
          Nigeria (CRIN) came on board.

          With regional governments formed after Nigeria achieved independence
          in 1960, research activities were regionalized, which eliminated
          federal government involvement. The&apos; regional efforts, however,
          did not yield the expected results prompting the federal government to
          once again intervene in the 1960s. This was followed by major
          reorganization and expansion of research institutes in the 1970s and
          the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria first came on board under
          Decree 25 of 1971. The first ARCN along with other sectoral councils
          were abolished in 1977 and a Nigerian Science and Technology
          Development Agency established in their place. Further changes came in
          with the Research Institutes Establishment Order in 1980, under which
          many research stations and departments were upgraded to national
          institutes.

          The research institutes underwent further significant reorganization,
